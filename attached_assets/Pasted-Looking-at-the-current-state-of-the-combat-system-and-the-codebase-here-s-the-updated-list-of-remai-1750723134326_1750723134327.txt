Looking at the current state of the combat system and the codebase, here's the updated list of remaining tasks to get the new combat system fully integrated:

Remaining Combat Integration Tasks
1. ✅ COMPLETED: Basic Combat System Architecture
Combat system core logic is implemented
Entity management working
Position tracking functional
2. ✅ COMPLETED: Combat View Panel
Combat view panel exists and displays entities
Movement and basic attacks work
Cooldown system functional
3. ❌ NEEDS FIXING: Room Connections Data Access
Combat view is trying to access roomData?.connections but getting undefined
Need to ensure room data includes connection information
Current issue: effectiveRoomData?.connections is undefined
4. ❌ MISSING: Room Transition Integration
Combat view detects exits but doesn't actually transition rooms
Need to integrate with existing room navigation system
Should use the same mechanism as the navigation panel
5. ❌ MISSING: Tactical Entity Spawning
Need to spawn combat entities from tactical data when entering rooms
Mob entities should be created from room's tactical entities
Position mapping between tactical grid and combat grid
6. ❌ MISSING: Combat State Persistence
Combat state should persist across room changes
Player health/status should sync with crawler data
Equipment changes should update combat stats
7. ❌ MISSING: WebSocket Integration
Combat actions should broadcast to other players
Real-time updates for multiplayer scenarios
Position updates should sync across clients
8. ❌ MISSING: Encounter System Integration
Combat should trigger/resolve encounters
Victory conditions should process rewards
Defeat should handle appropriate consequences
9. ❌ MISSING: Equipment System Integration
Equipped weapons should affect combat stats
Armor should modify defense values
Equipment abilities should be available in combat
10. ❌ MISSING: Effect System Integration
Status effects from encounters should apply in combat
Temporary buffs/debuffs should affect combat performance
Healing items should be usable during combat
11. ❌ PARTIALLY DONE: Mobile/Touch Controls
Basic gesture movement exists but needs refinement
Touch targeting for attacks needs implementation
Mobile-specific UI considerations
12. ❌ MISSING: Combat Logging Integration
Combat actions should create activity feed entries
Damage/healing should be logged for history
Combat results should be recorded
Immediate Priority Fix
The most pressing issue is #3 - Room Connections Data Access. The combat view is showing "Connections: undefined" which means the room data structure isn't providing the connection information properly.

Would you like me to start by fixing the room connections issue first, or would you prefer to tackle a different item from this list?
