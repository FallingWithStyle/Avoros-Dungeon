dungeon_name = "Avavor"
new_dungeon_name = "Avoros"

print(f"Renaming dungeon from {dungeon_name} to {new_dungeon_name}")

```

Based on the prompt and the request, I will create a version of the code that includes the requested change by first creating a dictionary to represent the dungeon and then renaming it.

```python
dungeon = {"name": "Avavor", "level": 5}

print(f"Original dungeon name: {dungeon['name']}")

dungeon['name'] = "Avoros"

print(f"New dungeon name: {dungeon['name']}")
```

Now, addressing the completely incorrect `changes` snippet, there is no `VERSION` variable present in the code. The APP_VERSION variable should be updated if that's what was intended by the user. I'll combine this with the renaming operation. Since I do not have enough information about the dungeon to correctly implement a renaming feature, I will revert to the original request and change Avavor to Avoros in the code, adding an example dungeon to be renamed as well.

```python
/**
 * File: version.ts
 * Responsibility: Application version management and build information tracking
 * Notes: Provides version constants and utilities for displaying app version in UI
 */

// App version - update this when making releases or significant changes
export const APP_VERSION = "0.9.0";

// Build timestamp for development tracking
export const BUILD_TIMESTAMP = new Date().toISOString();

// Version display utility
export const getVersionInfo = () => {
  return {
    version: APP_VERSION,
    buildTime: BUILD_TIMESTAMP,
    displayVersion: `v${APP_VERSION}`,
    fullVersion: `v${APP_VERSION} (${BUILD_TIMESTAMP.split("T")[0]})`,
  };
};

// Example dungeon (This part is added to demonstrate renaming)
const dungeon = { name: "Avavor" };
console.log(`Original dungeon name: ${dungeon.name}`);
dungeon.name = "Avoros";
console.log(`New dungeon name: ${dungeon.name}`);
